This large availability of data is efficiently exploited by employing deep neural networks in tasks ranging from image preprocessing and target recognition to high-level semantic feature extraction and object recognition. The present work involves creation of a model to perform instance segmentation in a wide variety of aerial imagery using Mask R-CNN, a state of art method for object localization, multi-class classification and segmentation. The results obtained from this work helped in further advancement of automation in analysis of data pertaining to Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) and other earth science disciplines."
