1,Instance segmentation in remote sensing imagery using deep convolutional neural networks,Anirudh Potlapally; Potluri Sai Rohit Chowdary; SS Raja Shekhar; Nitin Mishra; Chella Sri; Venkata Divya Madhuri; AVV Prasad,2019 International Conference on contemporary Computing and Informatics (IC3I),2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9055569,IEEE,"Over the past few years, remote sensing has found applications in various fields such as hydrology, geology, glaciology, military, agriculture, etc. The advancement in satellite and sensor technology enabled users to work with large amount of high resolution data of obtained from multiple sensors. This large availability of data is efficiently exploited by employing deep neural networks in tasks ranging from image preprocessing and target recognition to high-level semantic feature extraction and object recognition. The present work involves creation of a model to perform instance segmentation in a wide variety of aerial imagery using Mask R-CNN, a state of art method for object localization, multi-class classification and segmentation. The results obtained from this work helped in further advancement of automation in analysis of data pertaining to Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) and other earth science disciplines."
2,WoundNet: A Domain-Adaptable Few-Shot Classification Framework for Wound Healing Assessment,Anirudh Potlapally; Shubham Mahajan; Michael Briden; Harrison Shawa; Andrea Medina Lopez; Daniel Yoon; Amir Mazaheri; Hsinya Yang; Sara Dahle; Roslyn Isseroff; Narges Norouzi,2023 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10230601,IEEE,"Early detection of whether a wound is a ""healer"" or a ""non-healer"" using image analysis enables healthcare professionals to administer appropriate interventions. We propose a few-shot wound healing assessment framework, WoundNet, to classify temporal wound image sequences as ""healer"" or ""non-healer."" The contributions of this work are twofold: 1) Meta-learning: We study transfer learning approaches to train an image encoder for enhanced feature learning using domain adaption and contrastive learning, and 2) Few-shot classification: We classify image embeddings based on latent space similarity. We analyze the performance of the WoundNet framework in various settings, and experimental results show that temporal wound image sequences can be classified with an accuracy of up to 92%."
